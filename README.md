Recreating some of the W3 CSS templates to sharpen HTML and CSS skills

The [W3.CSS Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp) are some responsive website templates created by [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) for anyone to use. They are free to modify, save, share, and use in projects.

The purpose of this repository is to recreate some of them to sharpen my HTML and CSS skills.
